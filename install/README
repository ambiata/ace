What makes a good punter in the age of Uber and driverless transport? How imporant really, is getting from point A to B? Do we truly need to exhaust the lambda mines? Long and hard we thought, together we constructed the holy grail. From the best of robot transformers to the most polymorphic of strings, ace surely stands on the shoulder of giants.

A winning strategy, good abstraction, rigourous semantics. These are the things we don't need. ace will show you, beating the numbers with your robot transformers, is the way to victory. We have built something we do not understand.
