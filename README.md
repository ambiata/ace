What makes a good punter in the age of Uber and driverless transport? How imporant really, is
getting from point A to B? Do we truly need to exhaust the lambda mines? Long and hard we
thought, together we constructed the holy grail. From the best of robot transformers to the
most polymorphic of strings, `ace` surely stands on the shoulder of giants.

A winning strategy, good abstraction, rigourous semantics. These are the things we don't need.
`ace` will show you, beating the numbers with your robot transformers, is the way to victory.
We have built something we do not understand.
